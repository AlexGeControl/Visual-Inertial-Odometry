[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org),

### Browser Requirements

* Chrome 8, Firefox 4, Safari 6, Opera 12, IE 11, Edge 12, etc.

* HTML5 Canvas, WebSockets and Typed Arrays

* Fast Javascript Engine: this is not strictly a requirement, but without a
  fast Javascript engine, noVNC might be painfully slow.

* See the more detailed
[browser compatibility wiki page](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/wiki/Browser-support).


### Server Requirements

Unless you are using a VNC server with support for WebSockets connections (such
as [x11vnc/libvncserver](http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/),
[QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/), or
[MobileVNC](http://www.smartlab.at/mobilevnc/)), you need to use a
WebSockets to TCP socket proxy. There is a python proxy included
('websockify').


### Quick Start

* Use the launch script to start a mini-webserver and the WebSockets proxy
  (websockify). The `--vnc` option is used to specify the location of a running
  VNC server:

    `./utils/launch.sh --vnc localhost:5901`

* Point your browser to the cut-and-paste URL that is output by the launch
  script. Enter a password if the VNC server has one configured. Hit the
  Connect button and enjoy!
